A comparison of server-side node frameworks.
This may include frameworks with a browser-side component.

### Stack Integration

Traditionally, frameworks are explicitly server-side. However, there are now frameworks that are vertically integrated, i.e. integrate the client with the server.

| Framework  | Server-side | Client-side |
|-----------:|-------------|-------------|
| Meteor     | ✓           | ✓           |
| Express    | ✓           |             |
| Sails      | ✓           | ✓           |
| Koa        | ✓           |             |
| Derby      | ✓           | ✓           |
| Kraken     | ✓           |             |
| Hapi       | ✓           |             |
| Connect    | ✓           |             |
| Restify    | ✓           |             |
| Geddy      | ✓           | ✓           |
| CompoundJS | ✓           |             |
| Flatiron   | ✓           |             |

### Dependencies

Some frameworks are built upon other frameworks.

| Framework  | Dependencies |
|-----------:|--------------|

| Express    | [Connect][connect] for `< 4.0.0` |
| Sails      | [Express][express] |
| Koa        |             |

| Hapi       |             |
| Connect    |             |
| Restify    |             |
| Geddy      |             |
| CompoundJS |             |
| Flatiron   |             |

### Source Lines of Code

This is the lines of code a framework uses, not including comments.
This is used to gauge complexity and modularity of a framework.

| Framework  | Source Lines of Code | Version |
|-----------:|----------------------|---------|
| Meteor     |                      |         |
| Express    | 1,150                | 4.0.0-rc3 |
| Sails      | 5,350                | 0.10.0-rc4 |
| Koa        | 550                  | 0.5.1   |
| Derby      | 1,450                | 0.6.0-alpha3 |
| Kraken     | 680                  | 0.7.    |
| Hapi       | 4,750                | 3.0.0   |
| Connect    | 120                  | 3.0.0-rc1 |
| Restify    | 3,970                | 2.6.3   |
| Geddy      | 5,660                | 0.12.4  |
| CompoundJS | 3,010                | 1.1.13-1 |
| Flatiron   | 581                  | 0.3.11  |

Note: [sloc](https://www.npmjs.org/package/sloc) is used to calculate the SLOC. Most are simply counted by running `sloc lib` and `lines of source code` is used.

### Middleware/Plugin Signature

Different frameworks use plugins and middleware differently.
Some use objects, others use functions.
Some work with node's `req` and `res` objects, whereas many others do not.
A framework is considered `node-compatible` if each middleware uses node's `req` and `res` objects.

| Framework  | Signature                                          | Node-Compatible |
|-----------:|-----------------------------------------           |-----------------|

| Express    | `app.use(function (req, res, next) {})`            | ✓               |
| Sails      |                                                    |                 |
| Koa        | `app.use(function* (next) {})`                     | ×               |
| Derby      |                                                    |                 |
| Kraken     | `app.use(function (req, res, next) {})`            | ✓               |
| Hapi       | `app.ext('onRequest', function (req, next) {})`    | ×               |
| Connect    | `app.use(function (req, res, next) {})`            | ✓               |
| Restify    | `app.use(function (req, res, next) {})`            | ✓               |
| Geddy      | `this.before(function (req, res) {})`              | ✓               |
| CompoundJS |                                                    |                 |
| Flatiron   |                                                    |                 |

### Control Flow

Most frameworks use only node's traditional callbacks for control.
As we move towards ES6, we will see frameworks that use generators and promises to avoid callback hell.
Any framework without a `control flow` is assumed to use callbacks unless otherwise specified.

| Framework  | Control Flow |

| Express    |              |
| Sails      |              |
| Koa        | generators - [co][co] |

| CompoundJS |              |
| Flatiron   |              |

### Included Features

If a feature is not included, there is a very good possibility that it can be used via middleware or plugin.
Which features a framework includes or does not include is unimportant - its philosophy is.

## Contributing

When adding a new framework, you __must__ add the simplest metadata such as links, SLOC, stack, and dependencies.
Frameworks without a decent amount of stars are not welcomed.
Do not spam your brand new framework.

Performance comparisons are __not__ welcomed.

Metadata should be updated for the __latest stable versions__, including release candidates, but not including alpha or beta versions.
